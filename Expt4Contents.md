Procedure

   1. ate the training (development) and test (validation) data samples from original data.

   2. Develop model on the training data and use it to predict the distance on test data

   3. Review diagnostic measures.

   4. Calculate prediction accuracy and error rates

   ~~How to know if the model is best fit for your data?~~ 

   5. Calculate all the metrics listed here.
        
                            Add metric calculation formula

Code [R Code with necessary comments]

Output

      There must be a table showing the metric - three columns -> STATISTIC ,   VALUE,    CRITERION
      
       Table calculate all values refer - http://r-statistics.co/Linear-Regression.html
       
       
       
       

Result

Note: In report all the formulae's must be there and proper explanation should be given.
